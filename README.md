# get_packagelist_python

## Basic usage

Run get_packagelist.py to get a json dump of all (debian) system packages and python modules available in the current environment (excluding stdlib) including versions and a best attempt at install date.
```
./get_packagelist.py
```

## Development and testing
I've included a devcontainer.json so you should be able to spin up a working envinronment to test in using VSCode with little effort.
